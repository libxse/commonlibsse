# CommonLibSSE

### Requirements
* [XMake](https://xmake.io) [3.0.0+]
* C++23 Compiler (MSVC or Clang-CL)

## Getting Started
```bat
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/libxse/commonlibsse
cd commonlibsse
```

### Build
To build the project, run the following command:
```bat
xmake build
```

> ***Note:*** *This will generate a `build/windows/` directory in the **project's root directory** with the build output.*

### Project Generation (Optional)
If you use Visual Studio, run the following command:
```bat
xmake project -k vsxmake
```

> ***Note:*** *This will generate a `vsxmakeXXXX/` directory in the **project's root directory** using the latest version of Visual Studio installed on the system.*

**Alternatively**, if you do not use Visual Studio, you can generate a `compile_commands.json` file for use with a laguage server like clangd in any code editor that supports it, like vscode:
```bat
xmake project -k compile_commands
```

> ***Note:*** *You must have a language server extension installed to make use of this file. I recommend `clangd`. Do not have more than one installed at a time as they will conflict with each other. I also recommend installing the `xmake` extension if available to make building the project easier.*

## Notes

CommonLibSSE is intended to replace SKSE as a static dependency. However, the runtime component of SKSE is still required.

## License

[GPL-3.0-or-later](LICENSE) WITH [Modding Exception AND GPL-3.0 Linking Exception (with Corresponding Source)](EXCEPTIONS).

Specifically, the **Modded Code** is Skyrim (and its variants) and **Modding Libraries** include [SKSE](https://skse.silverlock.org/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/ianpatt/skse64)).

It is recommended to read the [FSF FAQ](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html) for a full explanation on what this license requires.

The main requirement of this license is: if you link your mod against CommonLibSSE, and you distribute the binaries for that mod, you must also distribute the source code under the same license as CommonLibSSE along with the source code for any other libraries you link against, with the exception of the Modded Code and Modding Libraries defined above.
